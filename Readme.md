# **India Housing Price Prediction using Deep Learning**

## **Project Overview**

This project establishes a robust machine learning pipeline for **predicting property prices (in Lakhs)** across various cities in India. The solution utilizes a **TensorFlow Keras Deep Learning model** and incorporates custom feature engineering, specifically deriving a **City Tier** classification, to improve predictive accuracy.

The pipeline is fully automated, covering feature engineering, model training, persistence, and interactive price prediction.

## **Key Features & Methodology**

* **Custom Feature Engineering:** A custom City\_Tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3\) is generated for each city based on the statistical distribution of average property prices, treating location as a highly informative feature.  
* **Deep Learning Architecture:** Designed a **multi-input Keras neural network** that specifically handles the generated City\_Tier feature separately before merging with core features for final prediction.  
* **Data Preprocessing:** Utilizes scikit-learn's ColumnTransformer for simultaneous feature scaling (numerical) and One-Hot Encoding (categorical) to prepare data for the neural network.  
* **Interactive Prediction:** Includes a console-based utility (model\_interaction.py) for users to input property details and receive an immediate price prediction.

## **Repository Structure**

| File Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| india\_housing\_prices.csv | The raw dataset containing property features and prices (target variable: Price\_in\_Lakhs). |

| train\_model.py | **Training Script:** Loads data, applies the City Tier feature, preprocesses features, builds, trains, and saves the Keras model and preprocessor. |
| model\_interaction.py | **Prediction Script:** Loads the saved model and preprocessor to predict the price of a property based on user inputs. |
| housing\_price\_model.keras | The **trained Keras Deep Learning model** saved for deployment. |
| preprocessor.joblib | The **fitted scikit-learn ColumnTransformer** saved to ensure new data is transformed identically to the training data. |

## **Workflow & Execution**

The project operates in three primary stages:

### **Stage 1: Generate City Tiers (tier\_generator.py)**

This script reads the housing data, groups prices by city, and uses price quartiles to assign a **Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3** classification to each city. This mapping is saved to city\_tier\_mapping.json.

### **Stage 2: Train Deep Learning Model (train\_model.py)**

1. **Data Preparation:** The target variable (Price\_in\_Lakhs) is transformed using a **logarithmic function (**log(1+x)**)** to normalize the price distribution.  
2. **Preprocessing:** A ColumnTransformer is used for comprehensive feature handling.  
3. **Model Architecture:** A Keras functional model is built with two inputs: one for core features and one dedicated to the engineered City\_Tier feature, allowing the model to learn its specific weight effectively.  
4. **Training:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

### **Stage 3: Make Predictions (model\_interaction.py)**

This script demonstrates how to load the saved model.keras and preprocessor.joblib files to predict the price for any new property.

## **Model Performance**

The model performance is evaluated on a held-out test set, with predictions inverse-transformed back to the original price scale (Lakhs).

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Test R-squared (**R2**)** | **0.9904** | 99.04% of the variance in housing prices is explained by the model – indicating exceptional fit. |
| **Test MAE (Lakhs)** | **10.76 Lakhs** | On average, the model's price prediction is off by only **₹10.76 Lakhs** – a high degree of precision. |

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Python** (3.8+)  
2. Install the required libraries:  
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow joblib

### **Execution Steps**

1. **Generate the City Tier Mapping:**  
   python tier\_generator.py

   *Output: city\_tier\_mapping.json generated.*  
2. **Train and Save the Model:**  
   python train\_model.py

   *Output: Performance metrics printed, housing\_price\_model.keras and preprocessor.joblib saved.*  
3. **Predict a Price:**  
   python model\_interaction.py

   *This script will prompt you for property details (City, BHK, Size, etc.) and output the predicted price.*
